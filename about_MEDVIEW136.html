			<h1>About MEDVIEW136</h1>
			<p><strong>MEDVIEW136</strong> started out as a brainstorm project between 3 colleagues: Amy V., Dr. Frankenstein and Nerdy McNerdington.</p>
			<p>While working together at their local hospital, they realized they experienced the same frustrations with most clinical software.</p>
			<p>Clinical apps with confusing interfaces, vague software documentation that only a Jedi could understand, etc..</p>
			<p>After several meetings with the software developers of their current patient dossier system, users still couldn't make their wishes clear.</p>
			<p>Most developers were focused purely on technical solutions, as opposed to sympathizing with the doctors, nurses and administrative staff.</p>
			<p>"We don't have time to babysit you whiny users!" was the usual response.</p>
